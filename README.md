# Mario-AI  

This project uses the simulated annealing algorithm for procedural content generation of Mario levels. The function used to
evaluate the quality of a generated level is based on a "funness" metric that the player assigns.

Player preference
modeling in this project is done using a human-in-the-loop approach. At the end of every
procedurally-generated level, the player assigns a "fun" rating (0="dislike" or 1="like"), which is then used to refine the initially defined evaluation function.
In this project, the map generation approach I followed is a hybrid one that combines constructionist and randomized optimization techniques.
That is, the constructionist approach first initializes a randomly generated map that is pieced together using pre-made building blocks. The simulated
annealing algorithm is then used to find the optimal configuration of components based on a user-refined evaluation
function.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository https://github.gatech.edu/sdai30/Mario-AI.git.

2. Install the required dependencies. For Java, install **ant**. For the game to build the player "funness" model, install
    **Python** and the Python libraries **numpy**, **scipy**, and **scikit-learn**.

3. Type **ant play** into the command line to play a customized PCG level.

4. After after every level, enter a "funness" rating when prompted.

5. Play more levels until an accurate regression model of "funness" can be approximated. By default, the file "ratings.arff"
contains sample ratings that were obtained after playing 50+ randomly generated levels. The file "svr_model.pkl" stores
the [support vector regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#regression) model that predicts the "funness" of a level generated by the simulated annealing algorithm.

## Commands
**ant compile**: Compiles src/ directory files.

**ant play**: Plays a custom level that uses procedural content generation.

**ant play-default**: Plays a random level that is built using pre-authored chunks.

**ant clean**: Removes the .class files contained in the bin/ directory.

**ant clean-super**: Performs a regular clean and then removes the ratings.arff and svr_model.pkl files.
